    Quickly summarize this conversation in a few sentences.

    The summaries should focus on retaining information to be used in an academic paper with the following abstract:
    [Eye tracking technology has emerged as a valuable tool for studying motor control, balance, and coordination during
     complex movements. This review comprehensively surveys the literature on applications of eye tracking in motor control 
     research. Studies demonstrate that analyzing gaze patterns provides insights into the relationship between visual attention
      allocation and motor planning and execution. Literature review plays a crucial role in identifying knowledge gaps 
      and building upon existing findings, such as work elucidating the role of head movements in maintaining steady gaze. 
      Research in visual neuroscience reveals the relevance of eye tracking across domains including sports training and 
      video game design. Examining different types of eye movements via oculomotor control studies informs models of information 
      processing and cognitive functions. Applications in sports and in conjunction with EEG shed light on perceptual and 
      attentional processes under physical exertion. Coordinated eye movements involve multiple cranial nerves, making isolating 
      individual nerve function challenging. However, eye tracking interventions show promise for improving control and cognition 
      in developmental disorders. Technological advances enable video-based eye trackers to precisely track gaze in naturalistic 
      environments. Synthesis of the literature indicates a robust capacity for eye tracking techniques to advance comprehension 
      of the complex perceptual and neural processes underlying human balance, motor control, and goal-directed movement.]
