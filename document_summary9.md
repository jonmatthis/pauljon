INDIVIDUAL CHAT SUMMARY

Eye tracking technology is used to measure the point of gaze or the motion of an eye relative to the head. It is used in various fields to understand visual interaction with the environment. Oculomotor control is the neural system that controls eye movement, involving the brain, cranial nerves, and eye muscles. Eye movements consist of saccades and smooth pursuit, with saccades being rapid jumps and smooth pursuit being the ability to track moving objects. Eye tracking has applications in research, such as studying attention and perception, and in clinical settings for diagnosis and monitoring of conditions. Eye movement behaviors vary across species, with primates using saccades and smooth pursuit for binocular vision. Animals with good eyesight use a saccade-and-fixate pattern to prevent motion blur, and this pattern is seen in both vertebrates and some invertebrates.

INDIVIDUAL CHAT SUMMARY

Eye tracking software uses computer vision techniques to differentiate the pupil from other moving objects. The software typically preprocesses the image by converting it to grayscale and smoothing noise. It then employs edge detection algorithms, such as Sobel or Canny detectors, to identify areas of the image where the intensity changes sharply. This helps to outline the eye, and the software can then locate the darkest region, which usually corresponds to the pupil. The code involves multiple steps and can be more complex, including additional processes like correcting for reflections and tracking the pupil over multiple frames for increased accuracy.
